# MLWE SAP
### Overview
* Implementation of Post-Quantum Stealth Address Protocol based on MLWE in Rust. 
* Uses a [fork](https://github.com/0x3327/kyber) of [pqc_kyber](https://github.com/Argyle-Software/kyber) and a [fork](https://github.com/0x3327/newhope) of [newhope](https://github.com/newhopecrypto/newhope) and [frodokem](https://github.com/microsoft/PQCrypto-LWEKE). 
* Since Newhope and FrodoKEM are in implemented in C, we provide wrapper in Rust. 
* Please refer to our [documentation](./docs).
